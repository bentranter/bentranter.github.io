Elon Musk is never going to fight Mark Zuckerberg, but if he did, what would he do to prepare for it (besides training)?

Given that the typical wardrobe for a "cage fight" is a pair of gloves and trunks, Elon's massive ego is going to make him want to look as good as possible shirtless, but:

* He's clearly out of shape,
* He's taken a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which is [likely muscle-wasting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6711418/),
* He's on, at most, a therapeutic dose of TRT,

So he'll need to do something drastic to put on muscle. Sure he could [blast](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blasting), but Elon is a busy person. He'll want the biggest transformation in the smallest possible time. His cardio is hopeless anyway (see above: busy person), so that won't be a factor in what compounds to deploy.

I predict that if Elon ever decides to fight Mark Zuckerberg, then he'll be the first billionaire on Tren.
