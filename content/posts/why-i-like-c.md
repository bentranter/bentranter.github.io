Modern programming languages have a ton features and save you from all kinds of errors. When it comes time to write code in those, you might be tempted to be as clever and concise as the language allows you to be. This might cause unintended side-effects. You could ignore things like data structure design, data flow, architecture, and more.

Not with C.

Since C is such a simple, old, insane-piece-of-shit-full of foot-guns, you’re forced to painstakingly design your application’s architecture and data structures in a way that tries to avoid as many categories of errors and undefined behaviours as possible. I think this leads to better program design, and totally eliminates any cleverness (outside of the pre-processor...), making good (or even acceptable) C code a joy to read.

Probably not a joy to maintain though.
