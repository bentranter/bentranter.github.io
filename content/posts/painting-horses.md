On September 12, 1940 in Montignac, France, a dog named "Robot" found a hole left by an uprooted tree. Along with three friends, his owner Marcel entered the hole to discover a [cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux), with walls covered in depictions of animals. Among those were 17,000 year-old drawings of horses.

Today, if you have the chance to visit the Van Gogh museum, you can see ["Horse"](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0202V1962) by Van Gogh, painted in 1886.

17,000 years ago, people painted horses. 137 years ago, people painted horses.

It's easy to feel like the world is changing fast, and that you're being left behind. Whether it's an industry, or society overall, you might have moments where you feel like you don't recognize the world you live in. I think we tend to overestimate the rate of change. It's true that things do change, but it's never by as much or as fast as you think. I don't know what the world will look like 17,000 years from now, but I do know that people will still be painting horses.
