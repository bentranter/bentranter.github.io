I'm a Senior Software Engineer at DigitalOcean. I've worked there since 2019.

I'm also the co-owner of [Sarah and Dipity's](https://sarahanddipitys.com), an online snack store in Thunder Bay. I wrote the custom online ordering platform used for the website.

I've worked as a software engineer since 2010.

Before my current positions, I worked for [MetaLab](https://metalab.com), [Walmart Labs](https://careers.walmart.com/technology), and a few other companies.

I currently maintain [Seatbelt](https://github.com/go-seatbelt/seatbelt), a library for building HTML web apps in Go, as well as a number of DigitalOcean's open source libraries. I was also the primary maintainer of [goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth/) for a number of years.

I co-authored a [video course on Go](https://www.packtpub.com/product/go-building-7-real-world-projects/9781788290494) for Packt Publishing in 2016. Luckily it's been retired, because it was not good.
